You can find in this tarball several .torrent files to test your client with.
These files are seeded on the epita network with real functionning clients.

The following torrents should create the following results:

Congratulations.txt_*.torrent:
  - Congratulations.txt

beej_*.torrent:
  - beej/bgnet_A4.pdf

images_*.torrent:
  - images/
    - bittorrent_surprise.jpg
    - california.jpg
    - deer.jpg
    - hourglass.jpg
    - lush.jpg
    - stuff.jpg
    - wall.jpg

advanced_dir_*.torrent:
  - advanced_dir/
    - dir1/
      - subdir1/
        - secret.jpg
      - surprise.txt
    - dir2/
      - wallpaper.jpg
    - empty.txt
    - empty2.txt
    - small.txt

archlinux_*.torrent:
  - archlinux/
    - archlinux-2018.12.01-x86_64.iso

Each .torrent file exists in 5 copies:
*_basic: all the seeding peers have 100% of the original files, and seed normally.
*_slow_disconnect: the peers disconnect sometimes, forcing you to recontact the
  tracker.
*_split: the peers have either the first 50% of the content, or the other 50%.
*_rogue: some peers send garbage data instead of real blocks.
*_seed: these torrents accept your client as a seeding client, allowing you to
  try your client in a "sandbox" environment. No peers are seeding on these torrents
  by default.

Please note that for all the .torrent files except the *_seed ones, your client
will *not* be added to the seeding peers list, meaning the peers returned by the
tracker will always be working as intended.
